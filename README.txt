Ball_Hell
======
Welcome to Ball Hell! This was a really quick game I threw together because I was bored, and it's pretty fun to be honest!
Dodge the balls to get points, seems easy right? Wrong! The balls progressively get faster and faster, see how long you can survive!
Have fun!

If you want the high score to work, change the path to your path in the code. I may update it to automatically do that for the user later on using os, but for now you have to manually change it.
