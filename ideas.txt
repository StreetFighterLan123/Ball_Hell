Ideas:

To Do:
1. High Score.
    A. Use shelf.
        1. Print the High Score to the terminal at the end, maybe print it above the score in the game? Idk.


Finished:
1. Add Achievements that pop up as text and then go away after a while.
	A. Make them go away by having a counter increment by 1,
	and when it is more than a certain amount it goes away.
